# Oil-Production-Forecasting

This project aims to predict annual oil production trends using machine learning models. By analyzing an 8-year dataset, we built robust forecasting models (Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost) to predict future oil production and visualize trends. The project includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and iterative forecasting.
